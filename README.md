# Hangman_python

Welcome to my version of the hangman game, this is a final project proposed in the course "Curso de Python: Comprehensions, Lambdas y Manejo de Errores" from Platzi.

This project was developed in Python and has two modes, normal and survival mode.

If you have some suggestions, let me know.

! Let's play in survival mode and share your finals scores! :D
